## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- The first_deploy file is customized for streamlit deployment.
- Notebook file is the RND file. Code could be pasted on jupyter/colab to futher try, test and play with the mechanism.

- NOTE - Any file doesn't have the api key setup or the key directly attached to it. To make it work, setup for api key needs to be done on github using yaml file and the notebook file is good to go just with just replacing the " xxxx " with the api key.
